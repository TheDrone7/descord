### SETUP

First off, be sure you have the following installed on your device.
- [Deno](https://deno.land)
- [prettier](https://prettier.io)
- A git client of your choice, [this](http://git-scm.com/) is the recommended one.

Nextly, follow the steps given below to set up the codebase.
1. Fork/clone the repository. Make sure you're on the `master` branch.
2. Make your desired changes.
3. Inside the codebase, create a new folder called `tests` to test the updated code before committing the changes. (THIS IS OPTIONAL)
4. If it's all good, run the following command in your preferred command line client - `prettier --write **/**.ts` and it will format your code to follow the codebase's code formatting as per the `.prettierrc.json` inside the repository.
5. Commit the changes and make a pull request to the repository.
6. Wait and your pull request will be reviewed (and *maybe* merged).
