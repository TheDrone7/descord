# descord
A discord API wrapper written using TypeScript for [deno](https://deno.land).

The library is currently in very early ages of development. It's being redone for the discord API v9 and aims to implement an entirely new apporach to discord bot library development. Please be patient while I complete this.

Thank you for showing interest in this project.
